Title: The Listening Machine

[The Listening Machine](www.thelisteningmachine.org) was commissioned by The Arts Council for the BBC’s ambitious [The Space](http://thespace.org) project, and runs for the full duration – May - October 31st, 2012.

Britten Sinfonia is one of Europe’s most pioneering chamber orchestras. Renowned for its diverse artistic collaborations and its ambitious new music commissions, the orchestra performs regularly in some of the finest venues in the UK and worldwide. Britten Sinfonia is a BBC Radio 3 Broadcast Partner.

To engage with The Space they have collaborated with technologist Daniel Jones and cellist/composer Peter Gregson to develop The Listening Machine – a musical representation of activity on the social media site, Twitter.

At the core of The Listening Machine is a piece of software which monitors the Twitter activity of 500 people around the UK, selected proportionally from eight different fields: arts, business, education, health, politics, science, sport and technology. A further part of the group is selected completely at random.

The machine analyses the properties of their tweets in terms of both sound, sentiment and meaning, and generates music in response. The sounds for the Listening Machine have been recorded by Britten Sinfonia.
