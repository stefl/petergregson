"Cello Multitracks" is perhaps the most vivid example yet of Gabriel Prokofiev’s fascination with modern dance music; the suite was written and recorded in close collaboration with Peter Gregson and was premiered in May 2011 at LSO St Luke’s in London, and has since been performed at venues including XOYO, La Gaite Lyrique and Joe’s Pub NYC  and festivals including Spitalfields, SXSW and Latitude.

The first piece in the suite, Jerk Driver, is being released as a single on Feb 13th (UK) and March 6th (R.O.W) and is studded with references to Grime rhythms and a heavily Rave-influenced refrain. The single features remixes from DJ Spooky, Marcas Lancaster, Back to the Source, Keith Beattie and Majiker
